# Controls for the game

## Position of the ship
* The front of the ship faces the mouse cursor at all times.
* To accelerate: Right Mouse Button
  * The further the mouse is from the ship, the greater the acceleration will be. (The ship speeds up faster if your mouse is farther away.)
  
## Shooting
* The weapon fires automatically, and the rate of fire can be increased by collecting the crate that drops occassionally drops from the top of the screen. The increase to firerate lasts until the end of the game, and the effect is cumulative.
* The initial speed of the projectile, like the ship's acceleration, is determined by the distance between the mouse cursor and ship's location.

## Main Menu and Pause Menu
* The game will start in the main menu. "PLAY" will start the game, "QUIT" will exit the game entirely.
* To access the pause menu, use the ESC key. The game will pause while in this menu. To access the main menu from the pause menu, select the "QUIT" option.
* Navigate with the mouse. The option you are currently hovered over will hilight.
* Select an option with left-click.

## Exiting the game
* ESC will bring up the pause-menu, use "QUIT" to get to the main menu, and from the main menu, select "QUIT" again.
* The "X" in the top right corner does not do anything when clicked on. This is intentional to prevent the player from accidentally clicking on it and closing the game when trying to move the ship.
